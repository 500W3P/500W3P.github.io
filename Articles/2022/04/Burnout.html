      <p class="articletext">
        Vampire Survivors is a fun little roguelike top-down shooter game from developer poncle with a simple premise: unlock powerups and gain experience to prevent getting overrun by literally thousands of enemy monsters. With relatively simple
        graphics that would not be out of place in SNES-era games a decent (if repetitive) soundtrack, and a straightforward 5-button control scheme, Vampire Survivors sells itself as a 3 USD core gameplay loop alone.<br><br>To me, Vampire Survivors
        most resembles flash games of the early 2000’s that I played on the school computer. The 30-minute gameplay rounds allow players to experience a surprising amount of gameplay events, make key decisions, and allow them to strategize on the
        fly. Certain characters almost require certain early level powerups to even feel remotely good to play, while others might sacrifice overall strength in favor of stronger early game benefits.<br><br>The game does not shy away from letting
        players become relatively overpowered. This isn’t a guarantee, and certain events that take place throughout each round may prematurely end a run before anything too crazy can occur. However, given enough time and with just enough luck, a run
        can certainly scratch the itch that only a build-expressive roguelike game can provide.<br><br>At the time of writing, only 18/24 of the character roster has been released with 6/10 of the stages available. I look forward to seeing the other
        playstyles. I really want to see this game completed and allowing for more build expression. That would be really cool for me.
