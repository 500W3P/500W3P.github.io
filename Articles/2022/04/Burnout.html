  <h2>"Burnout" refers to Takedown and Paradise.</h2>
  <p>
    The Burnout series was for the most part an excellent blending of racing and arcade game. What started out as a nifty "realistic arcade" game with Burnout on the original Xbox (at least for me) eventually brought us an excellent party and pure
    fun experience in Burnout 3: Takedown.
    The series then took some weird turns with the "Checking" system, allowing racers to crash into the previously-dangerous environmental traffic. To me, this was a bit too far into a lack of a penalization for sloppy play, whereas earlier titles
    rewards driving dangerously and punishing colliding into other non-racers.
    Eventually Criterion released "Burnout Paradise" in 2008 and all was well again. A great soundtrack pulling from various highlights from across the series and an open-world take on the classic Burnout formula proved exceptionally popular.
    Unfortunately, outside of a remaster of Paradise in 2018 no other mainline Burnout game has been announced; effectively meaning no true innovation has touched the series since 2008 (outside of the Burnout CRASH! game which borrows heavily from
    Takedown's Crash Party mode).
    Unfortunately, the Burnout series may be gone and no other series has filled that "arcade-like," "fun-over-realism," "reckless driving preferred" niche that it left.
